    Thank you for participating in our experiment. The goal is to test your ability to identify specific identifiers
    in different coding styles. Follow the instructions below:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill out the demographics form below.</li>
    <li>You will be presented with sentences composed of two or more words, such as "move south".</li>
    <li>You'll see a set of identifiers, one of which corresponds to the sentence you saw.</li>
    <li>Select the identifier that matches the given sentence.</li>
    <li>Complete a series of tasks, some involving camelCase and others kebab-case.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Demographics Form</h2>
